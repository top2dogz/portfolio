    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p> <b>My name is Izaac Salvador Ruiz,</b> and I would like to personally
        welcome you to my humble, electronic, and quite juvenile, abode. I am currently
        a third-year student @ UC Berkeley, studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences
        and I have decided to create a website for myself for three main reasons. For one, I've been
        I've come to the conclusion that I finally need some sort of platform to show what I've done at
        school. Besides the professional benefits of owning my own domain on the internet and all that
        stuff, I really just want a simple and concise way to display all my accomplishments to
        friends and family.
        2, I've always wanted to create a website for myself. In terms of goals,
        building a website has always been a close second on the list, right under
        the minecraft server that I built a few summers ago. However, I've always envisioned the creation
        of my own website to be a clear benchmark of my coding expertise.
        3, It's pretty much the most convenient option in terms of showcasing everything. To be brief,
        it's much more convenient to tell my parents to visit a website rather than having tirelessly
        explain GitHub to them
        
        <b>At the time of creation,</b>
        I intend for this website to mainly function as an interactive portfolio, but who
        knows what this might turn out to be. For now, enjoy my website.
