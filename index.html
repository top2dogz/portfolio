    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>Hello! My name is Izaac Salvador Ruiz, and I would like to personally
        welcome you to my humble, electronic, and quite juvenile, abode. I am currently
        a third-year student @ UC Berkeley, studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences
        and I have decided to create a website for myself for three main reasons. For one, 
        I've recently embarked on creating many different things over the past few years, and it suddenly occured to me:
        hey... why not create something that can showcase everything that I've created? (Essentially
        reinventing the portfolio)
        2, I've always wanted to create a website for myself. In terms of goals,
        building a website has always been a close second on the list, right under
        my 
        
        At the time of creation,
        I intend for this website to mainly function as an interactive portfolio, but who
        knows what this might turn out to be. 
        
    </p>
